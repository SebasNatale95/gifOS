**A GIF browser with upload functionality**

This project, based on the Giphy API, is a gif manager/search engine that allows you to see trending gifs, see suggested random ones and perform related searches, create custom gifs from the device's camera and download or upload them to Giphy, search for gifs (with autocomplete suggestions) and change the site theme from light to dark mode.
